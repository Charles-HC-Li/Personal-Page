        <h2>My AI Value</h2>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to enable machines to perceive the world like humans and coexist peacefully with
            humanity in the future. With the development of multimodal deep learning and large models, I believe
            machines will first achieve embodied intelligence, with genuine sensory perception and interaction
            between perceptions. They will also approximate having a "self" using the AGI "1-to-many" capabilities
            of large models. However, my ideal vision for machines is akin to the "550W-MOSS" digital lifeform from
            "The Wandering Earth," where they may possess their own thoughts, though I'm uncertain.</p>

        <p>Now, I'm curious about three questions:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Can we enable machines to cross-connect various modalities to enhance their comprehensive and
                    realistic perception of the external world, particularly through multimodal deep learning,
                    including aligning and generating various modalities?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Facing LLMs, I'm amazed by their ability to interact with humans using language, resembling
                    thought. Humans rely on brainwaves to receive and unify multimodal information. Can LLMs serve
                    as the "brain" of machines, using text as the medium to unify various modalities in an
                    ‚ÄúExternal-Prompt-LLM-Code-Agent‚Äù pattern? Is this approach feasible and stable?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What are the impacts of LLMs on humans and society? Can we improve their interpretability and
                    trustworthiness by studying their effects on humans and society? For instance, there's a theory
                    in communication called "embodied communication." Can this perspective guide the communication
                    between Machines and Humans&World?</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Some Articles of me</h2>
        <p>Here are some my thoughts. If in the future when I have my
            publication, this list will be divided into [Publications] and [Blogs] two sub-parts.<strong> This column is
                not in use at present, I will update it gradually after I have time.</strong></p>
        <p style="color: red;">I've made a lot of mistakes on my own self-study in the past, so I'll try to write an
            introduction to deep learning manual to summarize some of my experiences. If you are interested, welcome to
            join me!üìö</p>
